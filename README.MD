# ServiceDeskTool

This is a tool created for colleagues to create a simple way to run scripts against a 365 Tenant
The tool has a Clients.JSON file where you configure the UPN for the admin account you want to run the scripts with
This is done as the tool was created for a service desk team at an MSP so they are not always logging into the same tenant each time
I have quickly added a few scripts to get the first version available to get initial testing. 
I will add more scripts over time and continue to update the repoistory as I do so.
